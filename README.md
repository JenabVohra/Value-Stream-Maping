# Value-Stream-Maping
This project is about creating the value stream map.A visual tool that displays all critical steps in a specific process and quantifies easily the time and volume taken at each stage. 
Value stream maps show the flow of both materials and information as they progress through the process.
Value stream mapping (VSM) is defined as a lean tool that employs a flowchart documenting every step in the process.
Many lean practitioners see VSM as a fundamental tool to identify waste, reduce process cycle times, and implement process improvement. 
This is about the production in coco-cola factory , what are  there materials , how much is produced , how much is wasted , how much is preserved. 
The calculation is done in excel sheet while the other two files are about the value stream map diagram calculating the cycle time and log time.
